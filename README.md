### Hello There ðŸ‘‹!
Hello! I'm Ignacio; a Chilean community weaver and data science student. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±

Born in CopiapÃ³, in the northern part of Chile, I fell totally in love with AI and computer science when I moved to Santiago de Chile to study economics and business administration. Now I make all of my time to learn more and more about data science and AI at my university; the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile, where I founded AIClub@Chile. ðŸ¤–

While I'm not learning about data science and AI, I support communities so they can grow with a perspective of inclusion and co-creation. ðŸ«‚
